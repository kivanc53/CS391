CS391- Hotel Simulation Project.
Members: Can Yılankıran(S011483), Gökberk Arslantaş(S012719), Kıvanç Yılmaz(S012733).

Description of the project:
This simulation has been designed to train Hotel Management students on revenue management practices by applying their knowledge and skills on the online channels. Students
will make their decisions on the pricing of the rooms and channel management. The main aim is to generate the highest profit from the sales on the online channels at the end of the year.

Running the Application:
The program can be directly downloaded. index.html is the main page and it should be opened first. We used IntellijIdea while coding the application, and it can be opened and run
easily with it. There is no additional library needed.


Responsibilities of each member:
Kıvanç Yılmaz: I designed the UI style with the application of the CSS and helped my friends on other parts of the project.
Gökberk Arslantaş: I worked on the javascript part of the project and write the necessary functions for the login, register, and forms. Such as, checkRegister(), checkLogin(), show() etc.
Can Yılankıran: I worked on the HTML part of the project. I designed the overall layouts of the pages. Such as designing the header, footer, and body parts of all pages.

Usage Scenarios:
Firstly, we expect users to register with the necessary information on the register page. Such as username, password, email, name, surname, and student number. After pressing register button
they need to enter their credentials correctly in login page in order to access to the application. After logging in, users will be prompted with a help page where they can find relevant
information about how the simulation works. Users can navigate the application using the navigation bar under the header. This bar includes 4 tabs which are hotel info, operation, report and help(default). 
In the hotel info tab, users can find relevant information about their hotel which are hotel name, hotel location, budget, and room types. At the operation tab, users can make their decisions about room pricing and channel management. 
These 2 submit buttons currently have no functionality, this functionalities will applied at project 2, since we will be implementing server-client model at the second project. 
At the reports tab, users can analyze the results of their decisions. This tab is also empty for now, it will be filled at project 2 because of the same reason as the operation tab. 
Also, there is a log out button at the header that provides log out functionality to the users.
